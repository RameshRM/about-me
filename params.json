I love working on interesting products and thrive on developing products that works end to end.  I like the evolving of \"Web Technologies\" with Javascript being able to push the envelope of modern web.  ```Javascript``` lead the way for me from being an avid advocate of \"Strongly Typed\" languages from the likes of `C#`, `Java` etc.\r\n\r\n#### Contact\r\n\r\nEmail : [rmrmail@gmail.com](mailto:rmrmail@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nPhone : [6308773409](#)\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\n### Accomplishments\r\n\r\n#### Public Show Cases\r\n\r\n####  [Typewriter](https://github.com/RameshRM/typewriter)\r\n\r\n##### https://github.com/RameshRM/typewriter\r\n\r\n`TypeWriter` obviously refers to the keyboard.  This is a Javascript library to capture and abstract the keyboard specific eventing for DOM. This library is created from the inspiration of accessibility for the web and \"Github.com\" enabling to type and search from the Web UI.\r\n\r\n'TypeWriter` library abstracts the keyboard eventing from your DOM specific event binding, also provides easy access to bind to multiple keyboard events easily.\r\n\r\n#### [Cross Domain XHR](https://github.com/ebay/crossdomain-xhr)\r\n\r\n##### https://github.com/ebay/crossdomain-xhr\r\n\r\n`Cross Domain XHR` is a library to abstract `XMLHttpRequest` calls from your browser.  You might think why do we need a new library for XMLHttpReuest, where in the likes of jQuery exists.  The core problem this library addresses is \"Cross Domain Ajax Requests\".  This library provides ability to make standard CORS for supported browsers , for non-supported browsers provide a polyfill of \"IFrame PostMessages\". The library provides an option for you to choose configuration you want to use for Cross Domain Ajax calls.\r\n\r\n#### [Page Composer Framework](http://www.ebay.co.uk/vrt/fashion)\r\n\r\n##### http://www.ebay.co.uk/vrt/fashion\r\n\r\nPage Composer Framework is an extension modularizing web app development for Ebay pages.  This framework separates the concern and identifies Page WireFrame, Modules construct the data stream and the UI Component capable of rendering the module.\r\n\r\nPage Composer Framework - enables developers to store different meta data information about (WireFrame, Modules & UI) for a given URL pattern.  The consuming application will provide the URL pattern to the `Page Composer Framework` and render the page. This framework enables Ebay to evolve with custom built pages faster and provided experimentation for different modules with different data sources within a matter of hours.\r\n\r\n* This framework is designed from groundup and implemented by me , using `Spring MVC`*\r\n\r\n\r\n#### [Polymer Auto Complete](https://github.com/RameshRM/polymer-autocomplete)\r\n\r\n##### https://github.com/RameshRM/polymer-autocomplete\r\nThis is an experimentaiton on \"Polymer aka WebComponents\".\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\n#### Private Show Cases\r\n\r\n#### Document Imaging\r\n\r\n``` Document Imaging ``` as the name implies helps to digitize \"Patient Documents\".

This product contained two important features .\r\n\r\n\r\n#####  Fax Interceptor\r\n\r\n 1. Implementing an interceptor from Fax-gateway\r\n 2. Fax interceptor is a file system scheduler, always waits for file system change and triggers the image processor.\r\n 3. Image processor converts the incomming fax document to a relevant PNG file and store the PNG file in to a central database.\r\n\r\n##### Document Viewer\r\n\r\n 1. Displays the un-read converted fax documents (PNG documents)\r\n 2. Provides capability for the users to tag every page / range of pages to a particular patient\r\n 3.
